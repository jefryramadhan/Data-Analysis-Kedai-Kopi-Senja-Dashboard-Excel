## Project Background
This project is a sales analysis case study for a fictional coffee shop, **“Kedai Kopi Senja”**. The goal is to process raw transaction data for the period of June 2025 into an interactive dashboard. This dashboard is designed to provide business insights that can give the shop owner insight, helping them shift from intuition-based decision making to data-based decision making.

## Goals & (KPIs)
This analysis focuses on answering business questions such as:
1. Which products contribute the most to revenue or are the most popular, and which products are less popular?
2. What are the daily sales trends for products as of June 2025?
3. At what time does the store experience the most transactions/peak hours?
4. Which product category has the highest revenue?

## Process
This project include was several stages :
1. **Data Preparation:** Create fictive data with function in excel.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Cleaning data such as name inconsistencies, empty data, and incorrect formats using the `TRIM`, `PROPER`, `UPPER`, `Find & Replace`, and `Filter` formulas.
3. **Data Analysis:** Analyzing data using PivotTable to identify sales patterns and trends.
4. **Data Visualization:** Building an interactive dashboard using PivotTable and slicers for data visualization.

## Insight
Some key insights found from this analysis are:
1. **Product Dominance:** Latte coffee is the largest contributor to total revenue at 28%, while chocolate donuts are the lowest contributor at 11.66% of total revenue.
2. **Weekly Sales Pattern:** There is a clear sales pattern where peak sales always occur between Wednesday and Friday.
3. **Peak Hours:** The morning hours (12:00 AM - 11:00 AM) are the most crucial time, contributing 49.38% of total daily orders/transactions.

## Recommendations
Some business recommendations based on these findings are:
1. Add a new variant (mix with Latte) or increase the price of Latte by 5%-10%.
Evaluate the Chocolate Donut product by improving the flavor formula or replacing it with a new food item.
2. Create a weekday promotion on Wednesdays through Fridays with a 15% discount on every purchase of more than two drinks.
3. Add breakfast packages to the menu. For example, package A (donut + latte).
Allocate employees by adding employees to the morning shift.
